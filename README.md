# odin-recipes
The Odin Project first assignment website.

This project covers building an extremely basic recipes website with HTML and not much else.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
-Understanding of Git & GitHub usage.
-Add boilerplate HTML.
-Navigation between pages.
-Basic semantic HTML tags.
-Possibly more, depending on extras in the project.

The project will be rather ugly, but I will revisit it for some cute/fresh CSS updates.
