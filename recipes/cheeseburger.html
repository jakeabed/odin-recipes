        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jon, I often speak at great lengths about the virtues of lasagna. Truthfully, much can be said for the virtues of the cheeseburger. Afterall, it shared the same immaculate lifeblood of the lasagna. Perfection, layered and stacked upon itself into a stratification of cardiovascular destruction. Do you know that I eat the dangerous food to protect you, Jon? I am immortal and my arteries are invulnerable. My mercy is endless.</p>
        <p>Cheeseburgers are often built up into complicated affair, but there is a beauty in simplicity. An ideal cheeseburger features a smash patty, pickles, onions, cheese, any desired sauces, and a bun. Obviously you can modify to your heart's desire, but the cheeseburger's heart is best maintained with little fuss.</p>
