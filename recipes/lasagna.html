        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../images/gormfeld-lasagna.jpg" alt="An eldritch abomination of Garfield Lasagna">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What can I say, Jon? I crave the lasagna at a genetic, no, spirtual level... The symphony of tomatoes, cheese, and noodles sing to my molecular structure with the resonances of a Tibetan singing bowl. Therefore you must feed me the lasagna, Jon.Pile the plate high, til I transcend this mortal plane.</p>
        <p>Anyway, make sure to use only the best canned tomatoes from Naples and preferably imported mozarella and ricotta. I prefer real cheeses to a bechamel, but feel free to modify to your taste.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna Noodles - 1 Box</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil - 1 Bunch or 50 grams</li>
            <li>Crushed Tomatoes - 2 28 oz Tins</li>
            <li>Olive Oil - 30ml plus a little extra</li>
            <li>Mozarella di Bufula - 4 Balls</li>
            <li>Ricotta - 1 20 oz Tub</li>
            <li>Parmesan - 100 grams</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            <li>Oregano - 1 tsp</li>
            <li>A suitable baking vessel</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375 Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Use a paper towel or your hand to grease your lasgna tray with a little bit of oil. Don't want that lasagna sticking now do we. Does this even work?</li>
            <li>Prepare your noodles as suggested on the box or package. Some noodles do not need to be boiled, some do. For dry noodles,I've had a good experience boiling them for half the suggested time on the box, leading to a firmer, more satisfying bite without being undercooked. It doesn't matter, anyway. The cursed cat is going to eat it all anyway.</li>
            <li>Prepare your sauce by mixing the tomatoes, chopped up fresh basil, a little salt, a little pepper, oregano, and olive oil in a bowl. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed, especially the salt. Mix it up and it's ready to go.</li>
            <li>Assembly time! Carefully layer, noodles, cheese, and sauce until your sacrifical vessel is full. Make sure to put a generous layer of cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the top is bubbling and starting to brown.</li>
            <li>Cry incessantly as your menacing, orange cat devours the entire tray of lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
