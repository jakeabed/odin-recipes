        <h1>A Fine Cup of Coffee</h1>
        <img src="../images/gormfeld-coffee.jpg" alt="Gormfeld's eyes are bulging as he holds a large mug of what is presumably coffee.">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What can I say, Jon? Without the coffee, I cannot feel anything. My body feels like a raft at sea, aimlessly pushed about by the wind and waves. But then, like a sun cresting the horizon at dawn, coffee brings light to my sunken, hollow existence. What should be an unknowable rapture takes me to places that I could never imagine. Oh, Jon... if only you knew the feeling coffee brings.</p>
        <p>There's no such thing as a bad cup of coffee, but some are surely better than others. Pay close attention to the ratio of coffee to water, grind size, and consistency of actions while preparing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Filtered Water</li>
            <li>High Quality Coffee of Your Choosing (Preferably Single Origin)</li>
            <li>A Coffee Grinder</li>
            <li>A Scale</li>
            <li>A Timer</li>
            <li>The Brew Method of Your Choosing (I Recommend V60)</li>
            <li>Optional: A Gooseneck Kettle</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your water to boil on the stove in your kettle. Gooseneck is preferred for consistency and accuracy, among other things.</li>
            <li>Think about your life choices while assembling your coffee gear.</li>
            <li>Weigh the desired quantity of coffee on your scale, then grind it at the desired setting. Keep a log of your changes and cups to see what works best.</li>
            <li>Set up your brewer. If it has a paper filter, make sure to wet it first, preferably with warm/hot water.</li>
            <li>Think about touching the hot stove in case it makes you feel anything, before adding your coffee to the brewer.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, start your timer, then being pouring the water into the brewer. Make sure to be precise and consistent with the flow of the water.</li>
            <li>As the coffee finishes, either make note of the time or stop the timer.</li>
            <li>Although it would be nice to enjoy the coffee, you don't. Your ungodly abomination of a cat drinks it before you can have any of it.</li>
        </ol>
